## What's the Jenkins Operator?

Jenkins operator is a Kubernetes native operator which fully manages Jenkins on Kubernetes.
It was built with immutability and declarative configuration as code in mind.

Out of the box it provides:
- integration with Kubernetes ([Jenkins kubernetes-plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin))
- secure defaults and hardening (see [the security section](https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/docs/security/) of the documentation)

## Problem statement and goals

The main reason why we decided to implement the **Jenkins Operator** is the fact that we faced a lot of problems with standard Jenkins deployment.
We want to make Jenkins more robust, suitable for dynamic and multi-tenant environments. 

Some of the problems we want to solve:
- [installing plugins with incompatible versions or security vulnerabilities](https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/docs/getting-started/latest/customization/#install-plugins)
- [better configuration as code](https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/docs/getting-started/latest/customization/)
- [security and hardening out of the box](https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/docs/security/)
- [make errors more visible for end users](https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/docs/getting-started/latest/diagnostics/)
- [backup and restore for jobs history](https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/docs/getting-started/latest/configure-backup-and-restore/)
- orphaned jobs with no JNLP connection
- handle graceful shutdown properly
- proper end to end tests for Jenkins lifecycle
